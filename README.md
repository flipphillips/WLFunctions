# WLFunctions

![](icon.png)

A place to keep some of the things Iâ€™ve submitted to the [Wolfram Function Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/)

## Functions

### Accepted in WRI repository
- [`NotebookRelativePath`](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/NotebookRelativePath) - returns a path relative to the currently evaluating notebook.
- [`TimeSeriesZero`](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/TimeSeriesZero) - shifts a time series / temporal data object to start at t0 = 0 sec.

### Submitted
- `SecondsToday` - how many seconds have elapsed today.

### In Progress
- `UnitizedGaussian` - returns a Gaussian function whose value is 1.0 at its mean.
- `PropertiesAbailablilty` - returns a list of which `"Properties"` of an object are available and which ones are not.
- `GatherSortBy` - sort a list and then gather by the sort key.

### Note
I plan on migrating some of the more appropriate things from [`FPTools`](https://github.com/flipphillips/FPTools) to here, I think, maybe.
