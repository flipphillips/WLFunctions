A place to keep some of the things I’ve submitted to the [Wolfram Function Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/)

These will probably become ‘pacletized’ at some point, depending on the distribution model. I plan on migrating some of the more appropriate things from [`FPTools`](https://github.com/flipphillips/FPTools) to here, I think.
