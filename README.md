# WLFunctions

![](icon.png)

A place to keep some of the things I’ve submitted to the [Wolfram Function Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/)

## Functions

### Accepted in WRI repository
[`NotebookRelativePath`](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/NotebookRelativePath) - returns a path relative to the currently evaluating notebook.

[`TimeSeriesZero`](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/TimeSeriesZero) - shifts a time series / temporal data object to start at t0 = 0 sec.

### Submitted


### In Progress
`UnitizedGaussian` - returns a Gaussian function whose value is 1.0 at its mean.

### Note
These will probably become ‘pacletized’ at some point, depending on the distribution model. I plan on migrating some of the more appropriate things from [`FPTools`](https://github.com/flipphillips/FPTools) to here, I think.
